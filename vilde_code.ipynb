    "This small project aims to compare the real-life behavior of sorting algorithms with theoretical expectations. This requires measurements: real-life, physical experiments on computer code and data of repeated tests run on sorted data. In your paper, you shall implement and benchmark the following sorting algorithms, using the algorithms presented in pseudocode in the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insertion sort\n",
    "* Merge sort\n",
    "* Quicksort\n",
    "\n",
    "In your benchmarks, you shall use test data suitable to test the the behavior of the algorithms under the worst-case, best case and average-case scenarios. In order to study the scaling behavior of algorithms with problem size, one usually increases problem size 𝑛 by a factor, e.g., 2, 10 or 16 instead of increasing the problem size linearly.\n",
    "You can limit your largest problem size so that the full set of all benchmarks do not execute long on your computer. Drop test cases that take a too long time (e.g., large sizes for quadratic algorithms)"
